I'm a Systems Engineer graduated in 2012, who was always passionate about web development since my early days in college. My strength is Front-End Web development with emphasis on React and also have experience working with Back-End technologies using Node.js. Currently, my core tech stack is React, Next.js, TypeScript/JavaScript, Tailwind CSS and Node. I'm also familiar with React Native, Electron and other related technologies.

When I'm not coding, I like to play Chess, Basketball, Football and spend time with family and friends. Also, I enjoy learning new things, specially tech related stuff that can make my life easier.
