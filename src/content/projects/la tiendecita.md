The “Tiendecita.co“ was a freelance project I worked on for some local entrepreneurs in Colombia, the idea was to create a website for multiple restaurants with custom and easy to use CMS.

I worked on the architecture and setup of the project, mostly using HTML, CSS, Javascript and a basic CMS using Markdown files for generating the content of the pages.

My responsibilities were:

- Create the architecture and managing of pages using Grunt.js
- Create landing, product, history and contact pages
- Work on the CMS application using static content in markdown
