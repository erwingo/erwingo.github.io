I worked on this project as a Senior Front-end developer and was the lead of 2 more semi-senior front-end developers.

The project consisted of migrating the legacy website which was done using PHP and Backbone.js to a modern stack using TypeScript React with MobX for the front-end, NodeJS on the backend (using a proprietary framework done by Disney) and the video player used throughout all the sites.

The website consisted of several pages in which you can watch free episodes of some shows, signing in using your TV provider in order to access premium shows, localStorage user sessions in order to save your current list and progress of watched shows/episodes, managing multiple users/sessions in the same browser and several other features.

My responsibilities were:

- Think about and implement the migration strategy to use
- Sync with client and other team developers about the path to follow for the migration
- Understand the legacy code and how it works in order to translate those features to the new tech
  stack
- Implement new features using TypeScript, React and MobX
- Lead the front-end development team
- Lead the code review processes
- Unit tests, integration tests and CI/CD
- Work with the design team if any new feature or already implemented ones needed any changes
- Attend refinement meetings, daily standups, demo meetings
- Propose new features and modification/elimination of existing ones
- Implement analytics using custom client framework
- Work with custom NodeJS framework (Similar to Next.js) for page routing and server side features
- API integration using REST and NodeJS
- Use Sketch for design implementations
