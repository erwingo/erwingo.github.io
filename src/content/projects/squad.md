Squad was a very ambitious project, dedicated to help teams and individuals (specially models) improve their presence in social networks, by leveraging tools, campaign strategies and mechanisms to achieve so.

I worked as the technical lead front-end developer for a team of 2 more front-end devs, 2 backend devs (Python), a design team and other SCRUM roles that were part of the team.

In this project, I worked on the setup of the repositories, the decision making of the tech stack used for the front-end team and the general architecture. Also, I worked on the mobile application for iOS and Android using React Native, and later on the native iOS app using Swift.

My responsibilities were:

- Create the initial projects needed (landing pages, signin/signup components, main application, email templates repository)
- Implement features using TypeScript, React and Redux
- Lead the development of the Front-end team
- Create the mobile application for iOS and Android using React Native
- Create the iOS App using Swift
- Attend refinement meetings, daily standups and demo meetings
