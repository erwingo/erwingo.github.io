This project consists of multiple web applications (payments component, customer service component, etc) that are using the micro-frontend strategy in order to communicate and share state between them.

Most of the micro-frontend apps are developed using client side ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, Material UI and derived React technologies.
I worked on the initial setup of the micro-frontend using Webpack’s module federation feature, creating the “Shell” application which hosted all the micro-frontend applications that other teams within the company were working on.

During the mentioned process, I have to be part of multiple meetings with several software technical leads and discuss whether the micro-frontend approach would work for all the teams, since we also have the monolithic approach in mind.

My responsibilities were:

* Discuss and research pros/cons of Micro-frontend vs Monolithic architecture
* Investigate and create the micro-frontend approach for React applications
* Implement the micro-frontend approach using Webpack’s module federation
* Implement features using TypeScript, React and Redux
* Participate in code review processes for multiple teams
* Create unit tests and integration tests using React Testing Library
* Attend refinement meetings, daily standups, demo meetings
* Propose new features and modification/elimination of existing ones
* Work with design team using Figma for collaboration
* Work on the Profile Management app using ReactJS, MaterialUI, Redux Toolkit, Jest and React
Testing Library
