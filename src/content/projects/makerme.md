In this project, I worked for a couple of months, and was part of maintaining what was already there, also implementing some features requested by the client. Mostly, most of these features were done using Angular.js.

My responsibilities were:

- Maintain the legacy code with Angular.js
- Create unit tests and integration tests
- Attend refinement meetings, daily standups, demo meetings
- Work with the Design team about requested features
