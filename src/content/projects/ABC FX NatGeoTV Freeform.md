As continuation of the DisneyNow project, the client wanted to do the same for the legacy codes of the websites ABC, FX, NatGeoTV and FreeForm. These websites were very similar to DisneyNow with the exception of having working signin/signup components.

I supported the migration and was the tech-lead of 5 front-end developers in which we have to do almost the same effort in order to migrate these websites.

My responsibilities were:

- Understand the legacy code and how it works in order to translate those features to the new tech stack
- Lead the front-end development team
- Lead the code review processes
- Implement new features using TypeScript, React and MobX
- Unit tests, integration tests and CI/CD
- Work with the design team if any new feature or already implemented ones needed any changes
- Attend refinement meetings, daily standups, demo meetings
- Propose new features and modification/elimination of existing ones
- Implement analytics using custom client framework
- Work with custom NodeJS framework for page routing and server side features
- API integration using REST and NodeJS
- Use Sketch for design implementations
