Influx social was a dashboard tool to help users boost their presence in instagram.

The main application consisted of a dashboard with tools to help visualize, organize and make actions on the instagramâ€™s accounts linked to it.
I was in charge of all the front-end part of the application, communicating with the backend engine in order to get the responses from it back to the client, and display them visually using React-grid-layout and the D3.js library.

My responsibilities were:

- Create the initial projects needed (landing pages, signin/signup components, main application, email templates repository)
- Implement features using TypeScript, React and Redux
- Orchestrate API communication with the backend team using REST
- Unit tests, integration tests and CI/CD
- Attend refinement meetings, daily standups, demo meetings
- Work with the Design team about requested features
- Use ReactJS for the creation of the main application and other components
- State management using Redux, Redux Saga
