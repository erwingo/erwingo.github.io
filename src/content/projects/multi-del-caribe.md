In this project, I worked directly with the CEO in order to create a system that allows employees in Colombia to get access to low-interest loans. In this project, I was the only developer and was in charge of managing the database, front-end and back-end sides of the project. The project was later acquired by a bigger player in the country.

The application consisted of a website with signin/signup pages, in which we asked for employee information in order to validate the data, a CRM application done with ReactJS, NodeJS, MySQL for managing users. (Initially we went for a Wordpress solution but dropped it later).

Also, we created the same CRM app for desktop versions (Windows, Mac) using ElectronJS.

My responsibilities were:

- Create the initial projects
- Implement features using TypeScript, React and Redux
- Create and maintain the back-end with Node, database with MySQL and front-end with React
- Direct communication with the CEO about the progress of the project
- Create an easy to use CRM for the client
- Design and develop the components of the application
