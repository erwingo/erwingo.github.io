Rilo was a project that helps users create websites with ease using “drag and drop” functionalities as well as other easy to use tools to quickly generate landing pages, pages with interactive components and similar.

In this project, I was in charge, with the help of another front-end engineer, of creating the initial setup and architecture for the front-end application. Also, I worked on the development of the application which we initially wanted to do using Backbone.js, but after some research in the field we decided to go with Angular.js, which was rapidly increasing in popularity in the industry and seemed a very good opportunity to introduce it in our projects.

We used GruntJS as the bundling tool for managing the assets (Javascript, images, video files, etc) and the creation of the multiple index.html pages in the application.

My responsibilities were:

- Create the front-end application with Angular.js
- Create the architecture and managing of pages using Grunt.js
- Participate on the decision of tech stack chosen
- Create unit tests and integration tests
- Attend refinement meetings, daily standups, demo meetings
- Work with the Design team about requested features
