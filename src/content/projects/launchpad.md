In this project, I worked as a Senior front-end developer and was the tech lead for the effort of migrating the application from AngularJS (v1.3) to a modern Angular with TypeScript (v12) at the time.

I was also working on the creation of unit and integration tests of the already functionality, since there weren't that many.
In this project, we faced many challenges, especially dealing with the already obsolete Angular.js version which had many issues, but after several months of effort, we were able to complete the task.

My responsibilities were:

- Understand the legacy Angular.js code and how it works in order to migrate those features to the new tech stack
- Lead the front-end development team
- Lead the code review processes
- Create unit tests and integration tests
- Attend refinement meetings, daily standups, demo meetings
- Propose new features and modification/elimination of existing ones \* Work with Java on the backend for some requested features
