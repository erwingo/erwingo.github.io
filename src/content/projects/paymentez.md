This was my first ever project in the industry. I worked as a Junior front-end developer and was in charge of some of the landing pages used by Paymentez in Latam. Most of my responsibilities were to fix UI bugs presented in those pages, responsiveness of the website on Tablet/Mobile screens. Also, later in the project I was in charge of working on some components of the Admin dashboard related to the management of subscriptions. Here, I needed to use JQuery, Vanilla Javascript to handle the rendering and transition of the pages, as well as keeping the application state consistent throughout all of the screens.

My responsibilities were:

- Work on UI bug fixes
- Work on the responsiveness of the application on multiple devices
- Attend refinement meetings and daily standups
- Work with the Design team about requested features
