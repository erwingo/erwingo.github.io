In this project, we wanted to develop an online school for dating that worked as a subscription based platform in which the users can pay a subscription in order to access premium videos, live coaches and other perks.
We used ReactJS as the Javascript library/framework to develop all features used in the main application as well as the signin/signup components.

My responsibilities were:

- Create the initial projects needed (landing pages, signin/signup components, main application, email templates repository)
- Orchestrate API communication with the backend team using REST
- Unit tests, integration tests and CI/CD
- Provide feedback and results of the progress to the client and stakeholders
- Attend refinement meetings, daily standups, demo meetings
- Work with the Design team about requested features
- Use ReactJS for the creation of the main application and other components
- Use NodeJS for the signin/signup components (generating JWT tokens, keep user sessions alive, etc) \* Create the iOS version using Swift
