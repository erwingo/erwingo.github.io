I was in charge of multiple components of the project. Firstly, I started working on the landing pages, where we needed to use the latest UI features of the time, such as Parallax Effect and custom slide transitions for the main banner of the page. Later, I was moved to also work on the application itself, and part of the login component. In these ones, we mainly used Backbone as the Javascript framework for keeping the views, controllers and models up to date. Also, JQuery was used when needed for more custom components needed like Dropdowns, Forms, etc.

My responsibilities were:

- Create landing pages using latest features of the time
- Work on the application using BackboneJS and jQuery
- Create unit tests and integration tests
- Attend refinement meetings, daily standups, demo meetings
- Work with the Design team about requested features
- Create email templates used for marketing and customer communication
